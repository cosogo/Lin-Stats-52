## What

Lin Stats 52 is a Lineage stat calculator based on the l1j client. The idea is to keep the stat calculation modular so the class can be used with different projects that need to reference stat calculation.

## Why

This project started as a C# and modularization exercise, but I think it has become a useful program. Lineage is an old game and resources are starting to disappear. One of the main resources referenced was a stat calculator that only works via the wayback machine. This runs local, so you'll have it on your computer for as long as you like. Additionally, the stat calculation is handled in a separate class that I'm working on to be completely independent of the stat calculator itself. Theoretically, you could use this stat calculation with other programs.

## How

C# + XAMP
