 HP per level seems to use the following formula
 base Hp per level (dictitated by class) + stat hp per level (dictated by stats) + starting hp per level bonuses
	de 9
	elf 9
	illu 5
	knight 16
	mage 6
	royal 10
	dk 12

Mage stats:
Not sure about these formulas but it indicates that magic bonus is a totally separate stat.
Spell Damage = Base Damage + (Magic Bonus x Level of Spell)
spell power = magic bonus + spell level
