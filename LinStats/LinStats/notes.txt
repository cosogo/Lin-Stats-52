TO DO / FIX:
 - magicHit, weightCap formula is likely wrong, magicCrit, sp calculation is likely wrong,
 - document each stat bonus and verify it is correct
 - implement import/export
 - look into incorporating gear




Mage stats:
Not sure about these formulas but it indicates that magic bonus is a totally separate stat.
Spell Damage = Base Damage + (Magic Bonus x Level of Spell)
spell power = magic bonus + spell level
