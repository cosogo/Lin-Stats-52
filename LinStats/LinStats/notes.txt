TO DO / FIX:

- The way you add stats and it auto levels you by clicking the plus button is off. If I go to level 60 and want to assign the stat point, it will automatically put me at 61
 I'm wondering if removing the auto level when you increase a stat is the best way to go even if it makes the program more difficult to use. 


 HP per level seems to use the following formula
 base Hp per level (dictitated by class) + stat hp per level (dictated by stats) + starting hp per level bonuses
	de 9
	elf 9
	illu 5
	knight 16
	mage 6
	royal 10
	dk 12

Mage stats:
Not sure about these formulas but it indicates that magic bonus is a totally separate stat.
Spell Damage = Base Damage + (Magic Bonus x Level of Spell)
spell power = magic bonus + spell level
